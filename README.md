# Collection of examples for usage of the Liturgical Calendar API
A few examples of how to render a calendar, create an App, or create a widget, using the data from the Liturgical Calendar API and using different programming languages and web frameworks.

## [Fullcalendar](https://litcal.johnromanodorazio.com/examples/fullcalendar)
An example of making an AJAX request against the Liturgical Calendar API, and then rendering the results using [Fullcalendar](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar).

### Translation of the Fullcalendar example
The Fullcalendar example uses JSON files for all translatable strings.

## [Javascript](https://litcal.johnromanodorazio.com/examples/javascript)
A simple rendering of a calendar with Liturgical events from the Liturgical Calendar API, using Javascript both to make an AJAX request and to render the HTML of the calendar.

## [PHP](https://litcal.johnromanodorazio.com/examples/php)
A simple rendering of a calendar with Liturgical events from the Liturgical Calendar API, using PHP both to make a cURL request and to render the HTML of the calendar.

### Translation of the PHP example
The PHP example uses `gettext` to handle translatable strings. Many of the strings are in common with the API and the Frontend, which makes translation fairly easy through the translation tool (Weblate).
