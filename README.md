# examples
A few examples of how to use the Liturgical Calendar API to render a calendar, create an App, create a widget, using the data from the API and using different programming languages and web frameworks.

## Fullcalendar
An example of making an AJAX request against the Liturgical Calendar API, and then rendering the results using Fullcalendar.

## Javascript
A simple rendering of a calendar with Liturgical events from the Liturgical Calendar API, using Javascript both to make an AJAX request and to render the HTML of the calendar.

## PHP
A simple rendering of a calendar with Liturgical events from the Liturgical Calendar API, using PHP both to make a cURL request and to render the HTML of the calendar.

### Translation of the PHP example
The PHP examples uses `gettext` to handle translatable strings. Many of the strings are in common with the API and the Frontend, which makes translation fairly easy through the translation tool (Weblate).
